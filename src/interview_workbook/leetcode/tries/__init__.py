Tries (Prefix Trees) Category - LeetCode Problems

Prefix tree (trie) data structure implementation and applications.
Tries are tree-like data structures that store strings in a way that allows
    for efficient prefix-based searches and operations.

Key Concepts:
    - Trie node structure with children and end-of-word markers
- Insert, search, and prefix operations
- Memory-efficient string storage and retrieval
- Autocomplete and dictionary applications
- Wildcard matching with backtracking

Common Patterns:
    - Node-based trie implementation with children dictionaries
- Recursive traversal for complex operations
- Backtracking for pattern matching with wildcards
- Space optimization techniques for large dictionaries

This category covers:
    - Basic trie implementation and operations
- Advanced search patterns with wildcards
- Real-world applications of prefix trees
