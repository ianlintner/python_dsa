LeetCode 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing
a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve
any profit, return 0.

URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/
Difficulty: Easy
Category: Sliding Window

Patterns:
- Sliding window / two pointers
- Tracking minimum and maximum difference
- Dynamic programming (can also be solved with DP)
- Kadane's algorithm variant

Complexity:
- Time: O(n) - single pass through array
- Space: O(1) - only using constant extra variables

Pitfalls:
- Must buy before selling (can't sell then buy)
- Can only complete one transaction
- Profit cannot be negative (return 0 if no profit)
- Handle edge cases: empty array, single price

Follow-ups:
- What if you can make multiple transactions? (Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II)
- What if you can make at most k transactions? (Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV)
- What if you have a cooldown period? (Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown)
- What if you have transaction fees?

Key insights:
1. We need to find maximum difference where larger element comes after smaller
2. Track minimum price seen so far as potential buy point
3. For each day, calculate profit if selling today vs min price seen
4. This is a variant of sliding window where window represents buy->sell period

Connection to sliding window:
- The "window" is from min_price_day to current_day
- We expand the window by moving right pointer (current day)
- We contract/reset when we find a new minimum (better buy opportunity)

Alternative approaches:
1. Brute force O(nÂ²): Try all pairs, but inefficient
2. Dynamic programming: dp[i] = max profit ending at day i
3. Kadane's algorithm variant: Transform to max subarray problem
