"""
Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different
day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit,
return 0.
