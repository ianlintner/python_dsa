"""
Longest Repeating Character Replacement - LeetCode Problem

You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it 
to any other uppercase English letter. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing 
the above operations.
