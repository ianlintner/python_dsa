Sliding Window Problems

This category focuses on problems solved using the sliding window technique,
where we maintain a contiguous subarray (window) and adjust its boundaries
to find optimal solutions.

Common patterns:
- Fixed-size windows
- Variable-size windows
- Shrinking windows
- Multi-pointer tracking
- Frequency tracking within windows
