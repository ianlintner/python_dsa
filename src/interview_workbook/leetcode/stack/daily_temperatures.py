LeetCode 739: Daily Temperatures

Given an array of integers temperatures representing the daily temperatures, return an array answer
such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer
temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0.

URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Stack

Patterns:
- Monotonic Stack (decreasing)
- Index tracking for distance calculation

Complexity:
- Time: O(n) - each element is pushed and popped at most once
- Space: O(n) - stack can contain up to n indices in worst case

Pitfalls:
- Forgetting to handle remaining elements in stack (no warmer day found)
- Using values instead of indices in stack (need indices for distance calculation)
- Not maintaining stack in decreasing order of temperatures

Follow-ups:
- What if we need to find previous warmer temperature instead?
- How would you modify for finding next cooler temperature?
- Can you solve this with O(1) extra space? (No, need stack for optimal solution)

        Find number of days to wait for next warmer temperature using monotonic stack.

        Algorithm:
        1. Use stack to store indices of temperatures in decreasing order
        2. For each temperature, pop stack while current temp is warmer
        3. For each popped index, calculate days difference and store result
        4. Push current index to maintain decreasing order
        5. Remaining indices in stack have no warmer future day (result = 0)

        Args:
            temperatures: List of daily temperatures

            List of days to wait for next warmer temperature (0 if none)

Key insights:
1. Use monotonic stack to efficiently find next greater element
2. Store indices (not values) in stack for distance calculation
3. Maintain decreasing order of temperatures in stack
4. Each element pushed/popped exactly once â†’ O(n) time complexity

Algorithm steps:
- Initialize result array with zeros
- Use stack to track indices of unresolved temperatures
- For each temperature, resolve all smaller temperatures in stack
- Push current index to maintain monotonic decreasing order
