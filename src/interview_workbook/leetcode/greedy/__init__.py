Greedy Algorithms Category - LeetCode Problems

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, with the hope
of finding a global optimum. These algorithms are often used for optimization
problems where making the best choice at each step leads to an overall
optimal solution.

Key Concepts:
    - Making locally optimal choices at each decision point
- Proving that local optimality leads to global optimality
- Activity selection and scheduling problems
- Interval scheduling and resource allocation
- Huffman coding and compression algorithms

Common Patterns:
    - Sort intervals by start/end time and process greedily
- Use priority queues for scheduling decisions
- Prove correctness using exchange arguments
- Analyze when greedy approach is optimal vs. when DP is needed

This category covers:
    - Jump game problems with greedy reach calculation
- Gas station circuit problems with fuel optimization
- Interval scheduling and partitioning
- String partitioning with greedy boundary selection
