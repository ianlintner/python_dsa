LeetCode 45: Jump Game II

You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].
Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i.

Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1].

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
