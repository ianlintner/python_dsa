LeetCode 153: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (Medium)
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times.
For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
- [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
- [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the rotated sorted array nums of unique integers, return the minimum element of this array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.

Constraints:
- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5000
- -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
- All the integers of nums are unique.
- nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

Algorithm Insights:
- Use binary search to find the rotation point where the minimum element lies
- In a rotated sorted array, the minimum element is where the rotation occurs
- If nums[mid] > nums[right], the minimum is in the right half
- If nums[mid] < nums[right], the minimum is in the left half (including mid)
- Continue until left == right

Time Complexity: O(log n) - binary search
Space Complexity: O(1) - constant extra space
