Two Pointers Problems

This category focuses on problems that can be efficiently solved using 
the two-pointer technique, where we maintain two pointers that move 
through data structures based on specific conditions.

Common patterns:
- Opposite direction pointers (start/end)
- Same direction pointers (fast/slow)
- Palindrome checking
- Array partitioning
- Target sum problems
